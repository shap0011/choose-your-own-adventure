# The Fluffy Cat Adventure
## Introduction
><p>It was a lovely sunny morning in the middle of April. At that time, I was a true indoor fluffy cat and couldn't imagine what was going on outside. As usual, my human parent packed her computer into her bag and stepped out of the door. She didn't see me sneak outside and hide under the car parked near our house. I heard her footsteps fading away, and my heart filled with joy in anticipation of previously unknown adventures. This was my first (and so far, only) escape from home.</p>
><p>Suddenly, I heard a chirp, and I was confused about what to do next.</p>
