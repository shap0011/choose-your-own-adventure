# The Fluffy Cat Adventure
## Introduction
><p>It was a lovely sunny morning in the middle of April.  At that time I was a true indoor fluffy cat and I was not able to imagine in my mind what's going on outside. As usual, my human parent put her computer in the bag and stepped out of the door. She didn't see that I sneaked outside and hid under the car that was parked near our house. I had heard her receding steps and my heart was filling with joy in anticipation of previously unknown adventures because this was my first (and so far only) escape from home.</p>
><p>Suddenly I heard a chirp, and really, I was confused, what to do next?</p>
