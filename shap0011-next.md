><p>It's probably a new squeaker toy 🐱that my human parent 🧖‍♀️ bought for me recently," I thought. Despite feeling a bit scared 🙀, I decided to leave my shelter under the car 🚗 and run to the backyard. The new squeaker toy, which my human parent (probably) bought for me recently, was hopping in the grass and chirping 🐦. Curious, I crawled as close as possible to this creature. Suddenly, it flew up the tree. I jumped onto the tree 🌳 too. The squeaker 🐦 and I moved from one branch to another, higher and higher, until I found myself at the very top of the tree 😾. Unsure of what to do next, I decided to meow loudly. My second human parent heard me 👲. He brought a garden ladder 🪜 and rescued me from the tree 🌳.</p>
><p>Since then, I've been an indoor fluffy cat again, only watching the squeakers from the window.</p>
><p>You will be surprised, but I wrote a poem about my adventure. When my human parents pet me, I purr my poem to them. But they don't understand me 😻.</p>
