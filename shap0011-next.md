><p>It's probably a new squeaker toy that my human parent bought for me recently," I thought. Despite feeling a bit scared, I decided to leave my shelter under the car and run to the backyard. The new squeaker toy, which my human parent (probably) bought for me recently, was hopping in the grass and chirping. Curious, I crawled as close as possible to this creature. Suddenly, it flew up the tree. I jumped onto the tree too. The squeaker and I moved from one branch to another, higher and higher, until I found myself at the very top of the tree. Unsure of what to do next, I decided to meow loudly. My second human parent heard me. He brought a garden ladder and rescued me from the tree.</p>
><p>Since then, I've been an indoor fluffy cat again, only watching the squeakers from the window.</p>
